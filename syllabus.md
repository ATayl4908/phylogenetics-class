# Botany 563 Phylogenetic Analysis Of Molecular Data (UW-Madison)

Spring 2021: Tuesday and Thursday 1:00-2:15pm (online via Zoom)

**Instructor:** 

- Claudia Solis-Lemus, PhD
- email: solislemus@wisc.edu
- website: https://solislemuslab.github.io/
- office hours: Tuesday 2:30-3:30pm, or by appointment

**Class description:** 
A course in the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference from DNA sequence data. Students will learn all the necessary components of state-of-the-art phylogenomic analyses and apply the knowledge to the data analyses of their own organisms.

- Credits: 3
- Level: Advanced
- Breadth: Biological Science
- L&S Credit Type: Counts as LAS credit (L&S)
- Course Options: 50% Graduate Coursework Requirement
- This class meets for two, 75-minute class periods each week over the Spring semester and carries the expectation that students will work on course learning activities (reading, writing, problem sets, studying, etc) for about 3 hours out of the classroom for every class period. The syllabus includes more information about meeting times and expectations for student work

**Requisites:**
None, but strongly encouraged:

- A course in genetics/evolution/systematics
- A course in stats/probability

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to

1. Explain in details all the steps in the pipeline for phylogenetic inference and how different data and model choices affect the inference outcomes
2. Plan and produce reproducible scripts with the analysis of your own biological data
3. Justify the data and model choices in your own data analysis
4. Interpret the results of the most widely used phylogenetic methods in biological terms
5. Orally present the results of your own phylogenomic data analyses based on the best scientific and reproducibility practices

## Academic Policies
- The course syllabus provides a general plan for the course; deviations may be necessary
- **Recordings.** Lecture materials and recordings of this course are protected intellectual property at UW-Madison. Students in this course may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in this class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, you are not authorized to record lectures without permission unless you are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability requiring accommodation. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities. Students are also prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.
- **Evaluations.** Your constructive assessment of this course plays an indispensable role in shaping education at UW-Madison. Upon completing the course, please take the time to fill out the online course evaluation.
- **Academic Integrity.** By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UW-Madison’s community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. Substantial or repeated cases of misconduct will be forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for additional review.
- **Accommodations for Students with Disabilities.** McBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement: The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.
- **Diversity and Inclusion.** Institutional Statement on Diversity: Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals. The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from everybackground – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.
- **Religious Observances.** UW faculty policy states that mandatory academic requirements should not be scheduled on days when religious observances may cause substantial numbers of students to be absent. Refer to the university’s Academic Calendar for specific information.

### Even when this class will be online, we highlight the COVID academic policies that everyone at UW-Madison is expected to follow
- **Quarantine or Isolation due to COVID-19.** Students should continually monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested for the virus if they have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Students should reach out to instructors as soon as possible if they become ill or need to isolate or quarantine, in order to make alternate plans for how to proceed with the course. Students are strongly encouraged to communicate with their instructor concerning their illness and the anticipated extent of their absence from the course (either in-person or remote). The instructor will work with the student to provide alternative ways to complete the course work.
- **UW-Madison face covering guidelines.** While on campus all employees and students are required to wear appropriate and properly fitting face coverings (i.e., covering both mouth and nose) while present in any campus building unless working alone in a laboratory or office space. If any student is unable to wear a face-covering, an accommodation may be provided due to disability, medical condition, or other legitimate reason. Students with disabilities or medical conditions who are unable to wear a face covering should contact the McBurney Disability Resource Center or their Access Consultant if they are already affiliated. Students requesting an accommodation unrelated to disability or medical condition should contact the Dean of Students Office.
Students who choose not to wear a face covering may not attend in-person classes, unless they are approved for an accommodation or exemption. All other students not wearing a face covering will be asked to put one on or leave the classroom. Students who refuse to wear face coverings appropriately or adhere to other stated requirements will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards and will not be allowed to return to the classroom until they agree to comply with the face covering policy. An instructor may cancel or suspend a course in-person meeting if a person is in the classroom without an approved face covering in position over their nose and mouth and refuses to immediately comply.
