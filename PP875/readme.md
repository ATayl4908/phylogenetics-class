# Plant Path 875: Readings in Phylogenomics (UW-Madison)

Spring 2021: Friday 8:55-9:45am (online via Zoom)

**Instructor:** 

- Claudia Solis-Lemus, PhD
- email: solislemus@wisc.edu
- website: https://solislemuslab.github.io/

**Class description:** 
This course will be a journal club where students will read and discuss the current literature related to phylogenomic analyses. The course will focus on topics relevant for biologists using phylogenomics as part of their research. Topics include model misspecifications and violation of assumptions, propagation of alignment errors into the estimation pipeline, and evaluation of the limits of state-of-the-art methods on a variety of real-life datasets.

**Class website:** https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/tree/master/PP875

## Topics

We will read papers: 
1. related to weaknesses and limitations in phylogenetic inference:
    - Errors in the alignment/orthology detection
    - Model misspecification
    - Violation of model assumptions e.g.
        - Recombination
        - ILS
        - Gene Flow
        - Presence of Paralogs
        - Molecular clock
2. related to measures of support and confidence values for phylogenetic estimates
3. related to performance evaluations of widely used methods with messy data

## Format of the class

- The class will follow the structure of a jigsaw dynamic:  
    - There will be two groups in class: group 1 and group 2
    - Each group will read one paper ahead of class
- The class format will be:
    - 8:55-9:10 (15min): Each group will be in a breakout room where they will discuss their paper and prepare a 10-min presentation for the whole class
    - 9:10-9:25 (15min): 10-minute presentation of group 1 with 5 minutes for questions
    - 9:25-9:40 (15min): 10-minute presentation of group 2 with 5 minutes for questions
    - 9:40-9:45 (5min): Conclusions
