# Lecture 1

Welcome to Botany 563: Phylogenetic Analysis of Molecular Data!

First things first, let's go over the class [syllabus](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/syllabus.md) and the [class repository](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class).

**What this class is...**
This class is meant to prepare students to perform state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses. This class is very hands-on and students are expected to actively participate in class exercises and work at home.

**What this class is not...**
This class will not expect students to memorize formulas. There are no exams or homeworks to assess the specific learning of concepts. The class will be graded via a final project where all topics will be applied on a real data analysis of the student's interest.


## How do I take full advantage of the class?
1. Bring your own data to play with
2. Be reproducible from day 1 (more on reproducibility below)
3. Read the material in preparation for the lectures
4. Attend and actively participate in lecture and in-class activities
5. Join the slack workspace (more on slack below)
6. Join the journal club [PP 857 Readings in phylogenetics](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/tree/master/PP875) Fridays 8:55 am


## Reproducibility and good computing practices quiz

Let's see the level of the class on reproducibility and best computing practices with this poll.

## Phylogenetics background

Let's see the level of phylogenetics knowledge with this poll.


## Class communication: Slack

Everyone will receive an invitation to the class slack workspace. Let's use this time to go over the workspace for those not familiar with slack.

Slack rules:

- Everyone can post in any channel, but be careful to post things on the right channel (i.e. do not post announcements in the questions channel)
- Feel free to reply to other people's questions
- Feel free to post any resources that you find helpful for your fellow students
- Do not expect me to answer questions 24/7
- Use the thumbs-up option to vote for a question that I should go over in class or during office hours
