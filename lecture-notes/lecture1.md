# Lecture 1

Welcome to Botany 563: Phylogenetic Analysis of Molecular Data!

First things first, let's go over the class [syllabus](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/syllabus.md) and the [class repository](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class).

**What this class is...**
This class is meant to prepare students to perform state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses. This class is very hands-on and students are expected to actively participate in class exercises and work at home.

**What this class is not...**
This class will not expect students to memorize formulas. There are no exams or homeworks to assess the specific learning of concepts. The class will be graded via a final project where all topics will be applied on a real data analysis of the student's interest.

## How do I take full advantage of the class?

1. Bring your own data to play with
2. Be reproducible from day 1 (more on reproducibility below)
3. Read the material in preparation for the lectures
4. Attend and actively participate in lecture and in-class activities
5. Join the slack workspace (more on slack below)
6. Join the journal club [PP 857 Readings in phylogenetics](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/tree/master/PP875) Fridays 8:55 am


## Class communication: Slack

Everyone will receive an invitation to the class slack workspace. Let's use this time to go over the workspace for those not familiar with slack.

Slack rules:

- Everyone can post in any channel, but be careful to post things on the right channel (i.e. do not post announcements in the questions channel)
- Feel free to reply to other people's questions (in fact, this is the main purpose of having slack for the class)
- Feel free to post any resources that you find helpful for your fellow students
- Do not expect me to answer questions 24/7
- Use the thumbs-up option to vote for a question that I should go over in class or during office hours

## Reproducibility and good computing practices quiz

Let's see the level of the class on reproducibility and best computing practices with [this short poll](https://pollev.com/claudiasolis197). Note to self: the poll needs to be activated for students to be able to fill it out.

We will learn more about reproducibility in the next class, but here are some resources to get started:

- Read [Jenny Bryan's notes](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) if you did not even know there was a right way to name files
- Read [Cecile Ane's class notes](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/notes0922-markdown.html) if you have never used markdown/Rmarkdown
- Read [these notes](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) if you have no idea what the shell is
- Read [Cecile Ane's class notes](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/pages/schedule.html) (topics 1,2,3,5) if you are already familiar with the shell, but want to explore all of its potential
- Read [these software carpentry notes](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/) if you have never used git/github
- Read [Jenny Bryan's book](https://happygitwithr.com/) if you want to learn more about git and github for R users
- Read [these notes](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html) if you have tried to use git, but made a mistake and don't know how to fix it
- Read [Karl Broman's class notes](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/pages/schedule.html) if you are already a bit reproducible, but want to take your reproducibility skills to the next level

## Learning values

To conclude class, let's do an exercise on learning values. Open this [shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uBI-k4m0QDKSib70yAzawDMtbqxB4IC0EopSiYn_I2g/edit?usp=sharing).
